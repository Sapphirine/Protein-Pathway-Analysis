PTRF :Caveolae-associated protein 1; Plays an important role in caveolae formation and organization. Essential for the formation of caveolae in all tissues. Core component of the CAVIN complex which is essential for recruitment of the complex to the caveolae in presence of calveolin-1 (CAV1). Essential for normal oligomerization of CAV1. Promotes ribosomal transcriptional activity in response to metabolic challenges in the adipocytes and plays an important role in the formation of the ribosomal transcriptional loop. Dissociates transcription complexes paused by DNA-bound TTF1, thereby releas [...] 

SPTB :Spectrin beta chain, erythrocytic; Spectrin is the major constituent of the cytoskeletal network underlying the erythrocyte plasma membrane. It associates with band 4.1 and actin to form the cytoskeletal superstructure of the erythrocyte plasma membrane; Pleckstrin homology domain containing

RBP4 :Retinol-binding protein 4; Retinol-binding protein that mediates retinol transport in blood plasma. Delivers retinol from the liver stores to the peripheral tissues (Probable). Transfers the bound all-trans retinol to STRA6, that then facilitates retinol transport across the cell membrane; Belongs to the calycin superfamily. Lipocalin family
COL23A1 :Collagen type XXIII alpha 1 chain; Collagens

ATHL1 :Protein-glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine glucosidase; Catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose from the disaccharide unit linked to hydroxylysine residues of collagen and collagen-like proteins
